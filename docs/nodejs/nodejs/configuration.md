# Node.js: Configuration
## Babel
[Babel](https://babeljs.io) allows you to use newer JavaScript features that are currently not supported by browsers. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.babelrc`](../../../.babelrc).

### Plugins
* [@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties.html)  
  Enable class properties.

### Presets
* [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)  
  A smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environments. Target environments are determined by the project's Browserslist.

  The `modules` option is set to `false` because by default we want webpack to handle the ES2015 modules instead of Babel so it can perform optimizations like [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking). When running in a test environment, the option is set back to its default value (`"auto"`) so Babel can convert the ES2015 modules to a format Jest can understand.
* [@babel/preset-flow](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-flow)  
  Enable support for Flow.

## ESLint
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) helps identify potential problems and deviations from code style guidelines in your JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.eslintrc`](../../../.eslintrc.json).

### Environments
* ES6 (ECMAScript 2015): Supports all ECMAScript 2015 features except for modules
* Node.js: Support Node.js global variables and Node.js scoping

### Config Extensions
* [`eslint:recommended`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules)  
  Enables recommended rules for general JavaScript as defined by ESLint.
* [`plugin:flowtype/recommended`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype/blob/master/src/configs/recommended.json)  
  Enables recommended rules for Flow as defined by eslint-plugin-flowtype. Also sets [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) as the parser since the default parser ([Espree](https://github.com/eslint/espree)) does not support Flow.
* [`plugin:jest/recommended`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest#rules)  
  Enables recommended rules for Jest as defined by eslint-plugin-jest.

### Parser Options
ES2015 module support is enabled.

### Plugins
* [eslint-plugin-flowtype](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype)  
  Enables linting rules for Flow and allows us to use the `plugin:flowtype/recommended` config extension.
* [eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest)  
  Enables linting rules for Jest and allows us to use the `plugin:jest/recommended` config extension.

### Rules
These specific rules override any rules set by config extensions and will trigger an error if broken.
* 2 space characters for each indentation
  * `switch` statements use 1 additional indentation
* Line endings must be Unix
* Strings use single quotes instead of double quotes
* No semicolons

## Flow
[Flow](https://flow.org) is a static type checker for JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.flowconfig`](../../../.flowconfig).

### Ignored Files
All stats files generated by a build stats [`package.json`](../../../package.json) script.

### Options
By default Flow throws an error when it finds `require()` statements that use something other than a string literal. This has been disabled, mainly to allow the use of template literals.

## Jest
[Jest](https://jestjs.io) lets you build and run tests on your JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`jest.config.js`](../../../.jest.config.js).

### Options
`testEnvironment` is set to `node`.

`testPathIgnorePatterns` will have Jest ignore `node_modules/` (which is ignored by default) as well as `src/config/test.js` and `src/util/test.js` because these files are not tests and by default Jest looks for anything named "test.js".

## package.json

## webpack
[webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) builds the project. The config files can be found in the project's root directory as [`webpack.config.js`](../../../webpack.config.js) and within [`config/`](../../../config).
