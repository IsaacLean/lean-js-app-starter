# Desktop: Configuration
## Babel
[Babel](https://babeljs.io) allows you to use newer JavaScript features that are currently not supported by browsers. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.babelrc`](../../.babelrc).

### Presets
* [@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env)  
  A smart preset that allows you to use the latest JavaScript without needing to micromanage which syntax transforms (and optionally, browser polyfills) are needed by your target environments. Target environments are determined by the project's Browserslist.

  The `modules` option is set to `false` because by default we want webpack to handle the ES2015 modules instead of Babel so it can perform optimizations like [tree shaking](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking). When running in a test environment, the option is set back to its default value (`"auto"`) so Babel can convert the ES2015 modules to a format Jest can understand.
* [@babel/preset-flow](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-flow)  
  Enable support for Flow.
* [@babel/preset-react](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-react)  
  Enable support for React and JSX. When running in a development environment, the `development` option is set to `true` and enables useful developer features like [component stack traces](https://reactjs.org/blog/2017/07/26/error-handling-in-react-16.html#component-stack-traces).

### Plugins
* [@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties.html)  
  Enable class properties.
* [react-hot-loader/babel](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)  
  Enable support for React Hot Loader.

## ESLint
[ESLint](https://eslint.org) helps identify potential problems and deviations from code style guidelines in your JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.eslintrc`](../../.eslintrc.json).

### Environments
* Browser: Supports browser global variables
* ES6 (ECMAScript 2015): Supports all ECMAScript 2015 features except for modules
* Node.js: Support Node.js global variables and Node.js scoping

### Config Extensions
* [`eslint:recommended`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules)  
  Enables recommended rules for general JavaScript as defined by ESLint.
* [`plugin:flowtype/recommended`](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype/blob/master/src/configs/recommended.json)  
  Enables recommended rules for Flow as defined by eslint-plugin-flowtype. Also sets [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint) as the parser since the default parser ([Espree](https://github.com/eslint/espree)) does not support Flow.
* [`plugin:jest/recommended`](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest#rules)  
  Enables recommended rules for Jest as defined by eslint-plugin-jest.
* [`plugin:react/recommended`](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react#recommended)  
  Enables recommended rules for React as defined by eslint-plugin-react.

### Parser Options
JSX and ES2015 module support is enabled.

### Plugins
* [eslint-plugin-flowtype](https://github.com/gajus/eslint-plugin-flowtype)  
  Enables linting rules for Flow and allows us to use the `plugin:flowtype/recommended` config extension.
* [eslint-plugin-jest](https://github.com/jest-community/eslint-plugin-jest)  
  Enables linting rules for Jest and allows us to use the `plugin:jest/recommended` config extension.
* [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react)  
  Enables linting rules for React and allows us to use the `plugin:react/recommended` config extension.

### Rules
These specific rules override any rules set by config extensions and will trigger an error if broken.
* 2 space characters for each indentation
  * `switch` statements use 1 additional indentation
* Line endings must be Unix
* Strings use single quotes instead of double quotes
* No semicolons

### Settings
The React and Flow versions match the versions used in the project, as specified by [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react). These versions can be found in [`package.json`](../../package.json).

## Flow
[Flow](https://flow.org) is a static type checker for JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.flowconfig`](../../.flowconfig).

### Ignored Files
All stats files generated by a build stats [`package.json`](../../package.json) script.

### Options
Flow will look for files with the following extensions:
* css
* js
* json
* jsx
* mjs
* scss

Also these two lines are included so Flow will not error when styles are imported:
```
module.name_mapper.extension='css' -> 'empty/object'
module.name_mapper.extension='scss' -> 'empty/object'
```

## Jest
[Jest](https://jestjs.io) lets you build and run tests on your JavaScript. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`jest.config.js`](../../.jest.config.js).

### Options
`moduleNameMapper` is set to the following so snapshots can handle assets like images and fonts as well as styles in spapshot tests:
```javascript
moduleNameMapper: {
  "\\.(eot|gif|jpg|jpeg|png|ttf|woff|woff2)$": "<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/fileMock.js",
  "\\.(css|scss)$": "<rootDir>/src/__mocks__/styleMock.js"
},
```

`snapshotSeralizer` is set to [enzyme-to-json](https://github.com/adriantoine/enzyme-to-json) so Enzyme wrappers are converted to a format compatible with Jest snapshot tests.

## stylelint
[stylelint](https://stylelint.io) helps identify potential problems and deviations from code style guidelines in your CSS and Sass. The config file can be found in the project's root directory as [`.stylelintrc`](../../.stylelintrc).

### Config Extensions
* [`stylelint-config-recommended`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-recommended)  
Turns on all [possible errors](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint/blob/master/docs/user-guide/rules.md#possible-errors) in stylelint.

### Rules
These specific rules override any rules set by config extensions and will trigger a violation if broken.
* 2 space characters for each indentation
* Line endings must be Unix
