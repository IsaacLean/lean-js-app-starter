# Motivation
Today JavaScript offers a sprawling ecosystem of powerful libraries and tools that lets JavaScript developers create applications for almost any environment. While it's great that the language has grown beyond web browsers, unfortunately the new bells and whistles have also brought upon a lot of new complexity with tools and setup. Lean JavaScript Application Starter addresses this by allowing developers to use a starter project that handles all of the scaffolding for them, letting them to jump straight to their app code. Support for multiple environments allows for easy transitions or ports.

While many libraries such as React already offer standard CLI tools like create-react-app, they unfortunately obfuscate the setup process which can be a problem if developers need to understand what's happening behind-the-scenes or extend functionality. Sure the tools are often open source and have features like ejecting, but the source often lacks documentation or is very complex. Lean JS App Starter's small size and docs makes it easier to understand and customize, also making it a good configuration reference.
