# Lean JavaScript Application Starter
Skip boilerplate setup and get straight to the code you care about for your next JavaScript application.

## Overview
### üöÄ No Setup Required
Just download the release for your environment and start coding.

### üåô Consistent Codebase Across Multiple Platforms
Consistent JavaScript standard, webpack config, and dependencies no matter what environment you're building for.

### üë©‚Äçüíª Convenient Development Environment
**Automatic Reloading & Hot Loading**

No need to manually refresh, rebuild, and rerun your apps during development. Let a script automate all of that for you so you can see your changes as soon as possible. When coding with React, take advantage of hot loading so you can tweak components in real-time without refreshing and losing state.

**Server-Side Rendering Support**

Render React components on the server and neatly integrate your browser and Node.js codebases together.

**Useful Debugging Tools**

Tools, plugins, and scripts like Redux DevTools, Devtron, and many others are already setup for you to make debugging easier.

### üèõÔ∏è Build For Production

Build for production with one simple command that handles all of the optimization for you.

### üîß Fully Customizable
If you ever need to change the build configuration, you can easily do so. The starting codebases are small, easy to understand, and ready to adjust to all of your needs.

## Get Started
### üèÑ‚Äç Browser
**Download**

If you want to build an app for web browsers, start with the *latest `browser` release*.

**Examples**

You can find some example browser apps in the following branches:

- [`todolist-frontend`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/todolist-browser): A todo list app. Connects with mock backend API and can be run standalone.
- [`starchan-frontend`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/starchan-frontend): An anonymous text board called *chan (pronounced star-chan). Requires connection with backend API on [`starchan-backend`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/starchan-backend).

[Click here for documentation on building browser apps with Lean JS App Starter.](docs/browser/README.md)

### üåê Node.js
**Downloads**

If you want to build an app for Node.js, you have two options:

- *`nodejs`*: An Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose app starter project
- *`nodejs-ssr`*: An Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose app that supports server-side rendering of React components

**Examples**

You can find example Node.js apps in the following branches:

- [`starchan-backend`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/starchan-backend): An API for an anonymous text board. Optionally connects with the *chan browser app on [`starchan-frontend`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/starchan-frontend).
- [`starchan-ssr`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/starchan-ssr): A version of the *chan backend app that supports server-side rendering of React components. Can be run standalone.

### üñ•Ô∏è Desktop
**Downloads**

If you want to build an app for desktop, start with the *latest `desktop` release*.

**Examples**

You can find an example desktop app in the following branch:

- [`todolist-desktop`](https://github.com/IsaacLean/lean-web-app-starter/tree/todolist-desktop): A todo list app. Connects with mock backend API and can be run standalone.
