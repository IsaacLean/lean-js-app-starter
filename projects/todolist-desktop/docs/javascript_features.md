# JavaScript Features
This project uses Babel which allows you to use newer JavaScript features that are currently not supported by browsers. Another benefit to this is that now you can use the same JavaScript features everywhere, making it easier to transition between codebases for different environments or port your application.

Here are the newer features you can use with this project out-of-the-box:

* ECMAScript 2015 Standard: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/learn
* Class Properties: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties.html
* Flow Support: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-flow.html
* React Support: https://babeljs.io/docs/en/next/babel-preset-react.html
